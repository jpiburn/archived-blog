abstract = "Monte  Carlo  simulation  is  a  popular  numerical  experimentation  technique  used  in  a  range  of scientific  fields  to  obtain  the  statistics  of  unknow n  random  output  variables.  Though  Monte Carlo simulation is a powerful technique  for  the probabilistic understanding of  many processes, it can only be applied if it is possible to infer the probability distributions describing the required input  variables.  This  is  particularly  challenging  when  the  input  probability  distributions  are related to population counts  unknown at desired spatial resolutions. To overcome this challenge, we  propose  a  framework  that  uses  a  dasymetric  model  to  infer  the  probability  distributions needed for a specific class of Monte  Carlo simulations  dependent  on population  counts."
# abstract_short = "A mobile visual clothing search system is presented whereby a smart phone user can either choose a social networking image or capture a new photo of a person wearing clothing of interest and search for similar clothing in a large cloud-based ecommerce database. The phone's GPS location is used to re-rank results by retail store location, to inform the user of local stores where similar clothing items can be tried on."
