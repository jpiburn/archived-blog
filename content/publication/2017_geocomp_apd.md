abstract = "Frequently questions we ask cannot be answered by simply looking at one indicator. To answer the question asking which countries are similar to one another economically over the past 20 years is not just a matter of looking at trends in gross domestic product (GDP) or unemployment rates; “economically” encompasses much more than just one or two measures. In this chapter, we propose a method called attribute portfolio distance (APD) and a variant trend only APD (TO-APD) to address questions such as these. APD/TO-APD is a spatiotemporal extension of a data-mining algorithm called dynamic time warping used to measure the similarity between two univariate time series. We provide an example of this method by answering the question, Which countries are most similar to Ukraine economically from 1994–2013?"
# abstract_short = "A mobile visual clothing search system is presented whereby a smart phone user can either choose a social networking image or capture a new photo of a person wearing clothing of interest and search for similar clothing in a large cloud-based ecommerce database. The phone's GPS location is used to re-rank results by retail store location, to inform the user of local stores where similar clothing items can be tried on."
