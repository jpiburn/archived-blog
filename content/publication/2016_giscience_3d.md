abstract = "We present a 3D virtual environment leveraging 3D game dynamics for statistical analysis on spatio-temporal (ST) data. We present a theoretical construct, a proof-of-concept implementation (STWorld), and preliminary results from a human-computer interaction (HCI) study. Results include a novel integration  of the  Unity  game engine with open  source tools PostGreSQL, R, and the D3.js graphics library. Preliminary results suggest that STWorld may be judged more  enjoyable and incur better procedural memory retention than traditional dashboard interfaces. We conclude with findings on gender bias and the gap between gamers and non-gamers."
# abstract_short = "A mobile visual clothing search system is presented whereby a smart phone user can either choose a social networking image or capture a new photo of a person wearing clothing of interest and search for similar clothing in a large cloud-based ecommerce database. The phone's GPS location is used to re-rank results by retail store location, to inform the user of local stores where similar clothing items can be tried on."
